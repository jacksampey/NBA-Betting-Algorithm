NBA Late-Game Betting Strategy Analysis
=======================================

Overview
--------

This project investigates the hypothesis that betting on the favorite to cover the spread in the final minutes of late-window NBA games offers a statistical advantage. By leveraging data analysis, machine learning models, and statistical simulations, I aim to uncover insights into effective betting strategies and evaluate the predictive power of game-specific metrics.
